    <h1>Privacy Policy for MonuMente</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 2025</strong></p>

    <p>MonuMente ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h3>1. Information Collection and Use</h3>
    <p><strong>MonuMente does not collect, store, or share any personal user data.</strong> We believe in total privacy and data minimization. We do not require account registration or personal details to use the App.</p>

    <h3>2. Location Data (GPS)</h3>
    <p>To provide its core functionality—locating nearby monuments, museums, and points of interest—the App requires access to your device's <strong>location services (GPS)</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The App uses your current coordinates to calculate the distance to cultural sites and display them on your screen.</li>
        <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> All location data is processed locally on your device in real-time.</li>
        <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not track your movements, we do not store your location history, and we do not transmit your coordinates to any external servers or third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>The App does not use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or data-sharing SDKs that track user behavior or collect personal identifiers.</p>

    <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no information stored on our servers to be retained or deleted. Any temporary data used for GPS calculations is cleared as soon as the App is closed.</p>

    <h3>5. Children’s Privacy</h3>
    <p>MonuMente is safe for all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions), as no data collection occurs within the App.</p>

    <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
